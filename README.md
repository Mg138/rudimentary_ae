# Rudimentary AE

Adds rudimentary parts of AE2 to make it more compatible for earlygame usages, and disables channel capability for Ad-hoc networks.

Also disables most power usages unrelated to "storing" items. However, auto-crafting is (presumably) still going to cost energy.



The Controller's assets are modified from AE's Controller, and the credit belongs to its author.
